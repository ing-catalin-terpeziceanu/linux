What is operating system ?
**test**
Operating system (OS) is a computer software that manages computer hardware and additional software resource. It provides common services for computer programs.
The operating system acts as a middle man or bridge between computer hardware and the user. It provides a user interface and controls the hardware so that software can function.

There are different operating systems:
 - Desktop Operating System: Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux Desktop
 - Server Operating System: Microsoft Windows Server, Linux server distributions: Ubuntu Server, RedHat Server, Suse Linux server, etc
 - Mobile Operating System: Andriod, iOS, Windows Mobile
 - Embeded Operating System: different flavors/distros used in Routers, Smart TVs, Automotives, Home Appliances, etc


What is Linux ?
Linux in simple terms is a free and open source operating system.
Linux is very popular for its stability, security and flexibility.
It can be modified and distributed by anyone, which led to many distributions, each one accomodating different needs.


History of Linux
What was before Linux?
Before Linux, there was an operating system called UNIX (which still exists btw), developed in 1970 at AT&T Bell laboratories by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. 
It was a revolutionary operating system for its time, introducing many features which became standards. This OS wasn't free.
Later on, in 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU project (GNU it's not UNIX project) with it aim of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. While many tools and utilities were developed
under the GNU project, a complete free OS was missing a kernel.
Then, in 1991, the Linux was born. A 21 year old Finnish student, Linus Torwalds, started developing a free operating system kernel as a hobby project. It was a combination of the kernel and some 
utilities from GNU project, hence the Linux operating system.
Developers from different parts of the world started to collaborate creating new distros of Linux, like Slackware and Debian.
In the year 2000, Linux saw significat adoption use in several markets. It became the OS of choice for various emeging markets like embeded systems and computers.
In 2007 Google released Android OS Linux for mobile devices. This gaved Linux enormous boost in the mobile market.
Nowadays, Linux has grown from a hobbyist project into a powerful force in computing, powering everything from mobile devices, personal computers and servers, to supercomputers.
The principles of open source on which Linux is based, have also influenced the development of various other software projects.
So simply put, the story of Linux isn't about a computer system. It's about great people from all over the world working together and making this a reliable, secure, and open source  operating system.
Many thanks to them :)


Linux Flavors
When people refer to Linux flavors, they typically mean Linux distributions or Distros for short.
We have all these different distributions to serve various user needs and preferences.
Among most popular we'll mention these:
 - Ubuntu, one of the most popular distributions. It is based on Debian, it provides a user-friendly experience, and is backed by Canonical LTD
 - Fedora, sponsored by Red Hat, it is known for its cutting-edge features and innovations.
 - Debian, a community-driven project known for its stability, provides the foundation for many other distributions, including Ubuntu.
 - RedHat Enterprise Linux, a commonly backed distribution from Red Hat designed for businesses and enterprises. 
 - CentOS, originally free and open-source clone of RHEL, designed to provide a similar experience without the associated costs. Meanwhile, its direction changed with the introduction of CentOS Stream.
 - openSUSE, it comes in two main flavors: Tumbleweed, (the rolling release) and  Leap, which is a regular release sponsored by SUSE Linux.
 - Alpine Linux, a lightweight distribution designed for security, simplicity and resource efficiency, making it popular for containerized applications.
 - Kali Linux, a distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.

Each distribution has its unique features, strengths, target audience, and philosophy. The right distribution for a user, typically depends on their needs, preferences, and intended use case.


Linux vs Windows
 - Availability of source code:
     Linux: open source
     Windows: propietary software
 - Cost:
     Linux: free
     Windows: $$
 - User Interface:
     Linux: different desktop environments like GNome, KDE, XFCE and others. Users can even customize them. 
     Windows: Standard GUI
 - Command line interface:
     Linux: Console is the very core of Linux
     Windows: Command Prompt and Powershell
- Software installation and Package Managers:
    Linux: Software is generally installed using package managers like APT or YUM, but also manually.
    Windows: Software is mostly installed using standalone executable like .exe files. Nowadays Microsoft Store exists as well.
- Security:
    Linux: Linux is generally considered the most secure
    Windows: Less secure, more likely to become target of malware attacks
- Stability and Performance
    Linux: known for its stability and performance. It can efficiently run on new and older hardware. It is mostly used in servers and systems with a long uptime rating (years of uptime).
    Windows: generally stable, but tends to slow down after some time due to registry bloat, fragmentation and other issues like background processes and updates that keeps increasing.  
- File system:
    Linux: Primary file systems are ext4, XFS, ZFS and btrfs. It considers everything as a file including all the hardware devices. Its directory structure is hierarchical, beginning from the /
    Windows: The primary file system in use by windows are NTFS and Fat32. It uses drive letters and separate the file system from the user data into different directories.
